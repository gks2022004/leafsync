Key Features & Benefits
Reduced Latency:
QUIC combines the security (TLS) and transport handshakes into a single, faster initial handshake, resulting in quicker connection setup. 
Eliminates Head-of-Line Blocking:
Unlike TCP, where a single packet loss can stall all data streams, QUIC's stream multiplexing allows independent streams to continue data flow even when other streams experience packet loss. 
Built-in Security:
QUIC mandates Transport Layer Security (TLS), integrating encryption and authentication directly into the protocol rather than as an add-on layer. 
Connection Migration:
QUIC supports connection migration, allowing a connection to persist even if a user's IP address or network changes, ensuring a smoother experience. 
Standardized and Widely Adopted:
Originally a Google innovation, QUIC is now standardized in the IETF's RFC 9000 and is widely used for applications like HTTP/3, which runs on top of it. 
How it Works
1. UDP-based:
QUIC operates over UDP, which is a simpler, more flexible protocol than TCP, allowing for faster development and evolution of features.
